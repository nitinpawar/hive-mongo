hive-mongo
==========

This is a script which uses mongoimport to import data from a hive query 
to a mongodb.

There is a mongo-hive connector already existing but at the current state it 
does NOT support secure mongo clusters so I had to write this. 

Mandatory to have mongoimport on path
rest of the help if provided on shell script
